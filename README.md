# UniBridge
 UniBridge AI is an AI-powered resume optimization and job-match analysis tool designed to help students and job-seekers improve their chances of getting shortlisted. The platform compares a user’s resume with a job description, identifies missing keywords, scores compatibility, and provides actionable bullet-point improvements.

This project was built for a hackathon using the Lovable no-code AI development platform
